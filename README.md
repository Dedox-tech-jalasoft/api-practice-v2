# Insurance REST Api (Version 2)

This repository contains a second implementation of the previous [practice](https://github.com/Dedox-tech-jalasoft/api-practice). A small API aggregator was implemented using the Strategy pattern, which wraps two external fictitious insurance APIs and act as a single-entry point for clients.
